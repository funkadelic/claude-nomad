/**
 * Path segments that must never cross the sync boundary in either direction.
 * Defense-in-depth pair with `PUSH_ALLOWED_STATIC`: even if the allow-list
 * misses a path, anything containing one of these segments is hard-blocked.
 * Also the deny-list the `sharedDirs` opt-in is validated against, so a user
 * cannot symlink a host-local secret or cache into the shared repo by naming
 * it in `path-map.json`.
 *
 * Lives in its own dependency-free leaf module (imported by both `config.ts`,
 * which re-exports it, and `config.sharedDirs.guard.ts`) so the guard does not
 * have to import `config.ts` for it. That import was the load-bearing edge of a
 * `config.ts` <-> `config.sharedDirs.guard.ts` cycle; keeping the constant here
 * preserves the strict bottom-up, no-circular-import layering.
